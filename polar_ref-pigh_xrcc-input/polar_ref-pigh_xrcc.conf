# Values after the equal sign and before comments starting with # can be changed, but descriptions before the equal sign should not be changed and lines should not be added or deleted.
# Every sample used must have a SAM file and VCF file that includes data for all intervals in the intervals file.
# File_Sample_Name_File_path is required if Sample_Name_Species_File_path is provided and Use_File_Names is false.  
Project_path=polar_ref-pigh_xrcc-data/ # path where output data is written. Required.
SAM_files_path=polar_ref-pigh_xrcc-input/ # path to location of SAM files to be used. Required.
VCF_files_path=polar_ref-pigh_xrcc-input/GROM_bear_polar_ref-e10-3/ # path to location of VCF4.2 files to be used. Required.
Reference_file_path=polar_ref-pigh_xrcc-input/GCF_000687225.1_UrsMar_1.0_genomic.fna # path to reference file in fasta format that is indexed and fai file must exist in the same directory. Required.
Intervals_file_path=polar_ref-pigh_xrcc-input/ # Text file containing intervals of interest. Tab separated file. Format: chromosome_name (\t) start_position (\t) end_position. Required.
Mean_files_path=polar_ref-pigh_xrcc-input/mean_files/ # path to mean files. Required.
GFF_file_path=polar_ref-pigh_xrcc-input/GCF_000687225.1_UrsMar_1.0_genomic.gff # path to gff file in NCBI type format. This file is not required but will allow gene information to be plotted.
Use_File_Names=0 #0-false, 1-true. If false sample names must be associated with file names (File_Sample_Name_file_path below).
File_Sample_Name_file_path=polar_ref-pigh_xrcc-input/bear_file_sample-polar_ref-e10-3.csv # path that associates file names to sample names. CSV file, Format: fileName,sampleName. If not provided file names are used as sample names. 
Sample_Name_Species_file_path=polar_ref-pigh_xrcc-input/bear_sample_4_types.csv # path to file that associates sample names to species name. CSV file, Format: sampleName,speciesName. If Use_File_Names is true, file will contain fileName,speciesName.
Species_Name_Color_file_path=polar_ref-pigh_xrcc-input/bear_4_colors.csv # path to file that associates species names to colors (hex string with no #, example 808080 = gray). If not provided, random colors are used. CSV file, Format: speciesName,color
VCF_file type=SV_INDEL.vcf # type of VCF file. Default is .vcf but can be SV_INDEL.vcf for example. Entry is useful if only providing a vcf folder to filter files by ending.
Include_Species_in_Name=0 # 0-false, 1-true. If false sample names must all be unique.
Reference species=Ursus maritimus # Optional, white space separated. This field is used to generate URL when clicking on an exon and will open NCBI page for gene in reference species if species is present in NCBI.
